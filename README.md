## ⚡ Bot Overview

A fully automated **WhatsApp bot** with hacker-terminal theme, **real-time command handling**, and **media management**.  
Visuals simulate terminal hacking aesthetics with dynamic alerts and scrolling logs.

### **Extra Hacker Style Tips**

1. **Matrix-style text effect in GIFs**: record the bot output in green on black background → convert to GIF → embed.  
2. **Use dynamic badges**: e.g., GitHub Actions build status, npm downloads, or visitor counters.  
3. **Scrolling code blocks**: simulate a “live terminal feed” by chaining code blocks or GIFs showing commands executing.  
4. **ASCII art alerts**: `[!] ALERT`, `[✓] SUCCESS`, `[⚡] PROCESSING` for realism.

If you want, I can **create a fully ready README with placeholders replaced by “fake hacker animation GIFs and terminal visuals”** that will **look alive** on GitHub immediately—so you just paste it and push.  

Do you want me to do that?
